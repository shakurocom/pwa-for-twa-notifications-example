## A sample PWA application to act an example of TWA notifications

> A [repository](https://github.com/shakurocom/twa-notifications-example) with a sample TWA application.

This code is published and available [here](https://pwa-for-twa-notifications-example.vercel.app).

### How this example works
The PWA application receives a token from query params (if it is not there, then it offers to enter), and on an event it sends a request to create a notification, adding the token to the request body.
### Used in this example
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org).
- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).
- [Next-PWA](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa).
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
